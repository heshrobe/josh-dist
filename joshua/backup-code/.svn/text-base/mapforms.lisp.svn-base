;--- Common Lisp version conversion issues:
;--- use Common Lisp condition system to signal errors, when it has one
;--- BLOCK has to be processed in a very funny way?  See (RETURN MAPFORMS)
;--- Certain symbols, e.g. SYMEVAL, aren't CL function names any more
;                      Use the #+ reader macro to dike out
;                      thing like this. --jwatkins
;--- Uses extended DEFUN syntax for defining functions as properties
;--- Depends on having LOOP of course --
;              use the CL version of LOOP from gsb. --jwatkins


;;; Interface definitions

(in-package "JLT")

;; The entry functions to this module are MAPFORMS and COPYFORMS
;;  which take a funarg, a form, and keywords, and call the funarg on parts of the form.
;;  MAPFORMS-1 and COPYFORMS-1 may be called from inside the funarg.
;; The ARG-TEMPLATE declaration is used when defining a special form.
;; The MAPFORMS property may be used for complex special forms.
;; Errors detected are of two kinds:
;;  Problems with the form being mapped over signal FORM-NOT-UNDERSTOOD
;;	These errors may always be proceeded and will do something reasonable by default.
;;	This code isn't as careful as it could be about checking for dotted lists in forms.
;;  Bugs in MAPFORMS itself, or in templates, are signalled with ERROR.


;;; KIND
;; A piece of Lisp code has a KIND, saying what it is, independent of context.
;; The following kinds are forms (they get evaluated):
;;	QUOTE - a constant (whether quoted or self-evaluating or same-evaluating)
;;		i.e. this form is guaranteed always to evaluate the same no
;;		matter how many times and in what context you evaluate it
;;      FSYMEVAL - A variable reference in function position
;;	SYMEVAL - a variable reference
;;	a list - a function combination of any sort (normal, special, or lambda)
;;	  for special forms, the list is non-empty and its cdr is the arg-template 
;;	  to be matched against the cdr of the form (see next page)
;;	  for regular function combinations, the list is NIL
;; The following kinds are not forms:
;;	SET - a variable being setqed
;;	LET - a variable being bound
;;	DECLARE - a local declaration
;;	GO - a prog tag being gone to
;;	RETURN-FROM - a block name (prog name) being returned from
;;	ARBITRARY - an arbitrary side-effect not associated with any particular piece
;;		of Lisp code.  The code passed is just the name of the special form involved.


;;; USAGE
;; The context of a piece of Lisp code is described by a usage symbol.
;; These are the usages that the MAPFORMS funarg will see.  The somewhat
;; similar usages used in arg templates are described on the next page.
;;
;; The following usages imply evaluation, and tell something about how the result
;; of the evaluation is used:
;;	EVAL - general case
;;	TEST - all that matters is whether the value is NIL
;;	EFFECT - the value is not used
;;	SMASH - the resulting object is modified (e.g. NREVERSE)
;;	PROP - the result is used as a property name
;;	FUNCTION - the result is used as a function
;;  more of these are likely to be added in the future; unrecognized usages should be
;;  assumed to imply evaluation
;;--- SMASH and PROP templates have not been put in on the many functions that would
;;--- need them.  Interlisp seems to find these useful; we could put them in someday.
;;  The KIND of a form used with one of the above usages will necessarily be
;;  one of the "form" kinds: QUOTE, SYMEVAL, or a list.
;;
;; The following usages do not imply evaluation, hence don't go with forms:
;;	QUOTE - a subform that is not evaluated
;;	SET - a variable being setq'ed
;;	LET - a variable being bound
;;	SYMEVAL - a variable used as a variable (but not a form)
;;	CALL - a function (typically inside of #')
;;	FLAVOR:GENERIC - a generic function, as found inside (FLAVOR:GENERIC FOO)
;;	GO - a prog tag being gone to
;;	RETURN-FROM - a block name being returned from
;;	DECLARE - a local declaration
;;	ARBITRARY - some arbitrary side-effect is occurring, not associated
;;			with a particular form.  The piece of Lisp code
;;			is the name of the special form involved.
;; Each of the above non-form usages has a characteristic KIND that goes with
;; it.  This is the same symbol, except for CALL where the KIND is QUOTE.


;;; ARG-TEMPLATE declaration
;;
;; An argument template is a tree which is matched against the cdr of a form.
;; Leaves of the tree are symbols or lists with special symbols in their car,
;; and usually match forms to be evaluated (sometimes they match special syntactic
;; things).  The leaves define where the forms to be evaluated are and also
;; something about how the arguments are used.  Thus many of the symbols that
;; may be used as leaves are the same as the USAGE symbols listed above.
;;
;; Possible leaves are:
;;	QUOTE - this expression is not evaluated
;;	SET - a variable appearing here is setqed
;;	LET - a variable appearing here is bound (a list is a variable and a value)
;;      LETF - Like LET, but an expression is allowed.  This is a Zetalisp feature
;;	PARALLEL-LET - like ((REPEAT LET)) but the bindings are done in parallel
;;      PARALLEL-LETF - combine the features of LETF and PARALLEL-LET
;;	SYMEVAL - a variable appearing here is used as a variable (but is not a form)
;;	CALL - this expression is not evaluated, but if it is a function it is called
;;	BODY - any number of expressions, all but the last for effect ("progn")
;;	DECLARE - any number of local declarations and documentation strings may appear here
;;	  (the funarg sees single declarations with a usage of DECLARE)
;; 	PROG - prog tags and forms evaluated for effect (a prog body)
;;	GO - this expression is not evaluated (it's a prog tag being gone to)
;;	RETURN-FROM - this expression is not evaluated (it's a block name being returned from)
;;	BLOCK - this expression is not evaluated (it's a block name being defined)
;;	EVAL - a form is evaluated
;;	TEST - a form is evaluated, but all that matters is whether the value is NIL
;;	EFFECT - a form is evaluated, but its value is not used
;; 	RETURN - a form is evaluated, and its value is also the value of the whole form
;;	SMASH - a form is evaluated and the resulting object is modified (e.g. NREVERSE)
;;	PROP - a form is evaluated and the result is used as a property name
;;	FUNCTION - a form is evaluated and the result is used as a function
;;	ARBITRARY - does not match any subform; indicates that an arbitrary
;;		side-effect occurs at this point.  This is an "escape hatch"
;;		for special forms that don't fit in to the model very well.
;;   The next three are attributes of the whole form and don't match any subforms
;;   These must appear at the front of a template
;;	COND - this form is a conditional; it doesn't necessarily evaluate all its subforms.
;;	LOOP - this form is an iteration; it may evaluate some subforms no or multiple times.
;; 	ANONYMOUS-BLOCK - indicates an unnamed prog
;;   The remaining leaves are "complex".
;;    REPEAT and ORDER match multiple subforms, the others match one.
;;	(REPEAT template template...) - the sequence of templates is repeated zero
;;		or more times, to match the length of the form
;;	(IF predicate true-template false-template) - use predicate to decide
;;		which template to use.  If predicate is atomic, it is a function
;;		applied to the matching expression, otherwise it is a form to
;;		to evaluate with EXPR bound to the matching expression.
;;	(ORDER (n template) (n template)...) - the next several subforms are matched
;;		to the templates in order.  But the order of evaluation (and hence
;;		of mapforms processing) is not left-to-right, but is according
;;		to increasing numerical order of the numbers "n".
;;		By special hair, one of the templates may be a REPEAT.
;;   The following two can really screw things up when the correspondence between
;;   what is analyzed and the original code matters.  Fortunately they aren't
;;   used currently.  They come from Interlisp.
;;	(AND template template...) - all of the templates specified apply
;;		this causes the matching expression to be analyzed multiple times
;;	(MACRO expr template) - expr and template are forms to be evaluated,
;;		with EXPR bound to the matching expression.  Use the results as
;;		the new matching expression and the new template.
;;  more of these are likely to be added in the future; unrecognized symbols should be
;;  assumed to imply evaluation
;;
;; Error if the form is longer than the template, but not vice versa (optional args).
;;
;; Example declaration for COND:
;;	(DECLARE (ARG-TEMPLATE COND (REPEAT (TEST . BODY))))
;; For IF (with multi-else feature):
;;	(DECLARE (ARG-TEMPLATE COND TEST RETURN . BODY))

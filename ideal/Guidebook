Guidebook to Rockwell's IDEAL system-------------------------------------------------------------------------------The top level directory has the following important files:README		Overview, load and startup instructionsContents	A list of files and directoriesVersion		Includes version information on the systemload-ideal.lisp	  How to load the IDEAL systemsysdcl.lisp		  Simple definitions and loaders for IDEALtranslations.lisp	  logical pathname translations for IDEALThe manuals for IDEAL are located in the documentation directory.  Werecommend that the manual.txt document be used only if you don't have accessto LaTex or a postscript printer - the txt file is automatically generated andits formatting is not perfect.The IDEAL system alone has only a programmatic interface.  The IDEAL-EDITsystem provides a CLIM 1.1 GUI to IDEAL, and is included as a subdirectorywithin the top-level IDEAL system.

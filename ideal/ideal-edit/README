--------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a brief overview of the IDEAL-EDIT system, and details on loading thesystem. --------------------------------------------------------------------------           IDEAL-EDIT: A Graphic Editor for the IDEAL system        --------------------------------------------------------                Rockwell International Science Center                          Palo Alto, CA What IDEAL-EDIT is-------------------IDEAL-EDIT is a CLIM based graphical editor which runs over the IDEALinfluence diagram analysis system. For information on IDEAL, see theREADME files for IDEAL in the parent directory of this one.Implementation details----------------------- IDEAL-EDIT is written in CLIM 1.1 and it uses some of the functionality ofCLTL2 including CLOS, the LOOP macro, and the condition system.  It has beentested in LUCID Common Lisp and Allegro Common Lisp on Sun workstations,Macintosh Common Lisp and on Genera 8.0. We anticipate it will run withminimal porting on any CLIM platform. How to get started------------------1. Print out the IDEAL-EDIT manual.2. Read the loading instructions at the end of this file to load   the system.Contacting us------------- Jack Breese                    breese@rpal.rockwell.com  (415) 325-1871 Rockwell International Science Center,  444 High St, Palo Alto, CA 94301Loading Instructions--------------------NON-SYMBOLICS SYSTEMS:Start up a base lisp world which includes CLIM 1.X, CLOS, the CLTL2 LOOP macro  and the CLTL2 condition system.Load the file load-ideal-edit.lispExecute the function (user::load-ideal-edit) or (user::compile-ideal-edit)SYMBOLICS SYSTEMS:It will be necessary to set up the X.system and X.translations files requiredby genera for a system X.  This should be done by the site administrator.  Thetranslations file should mirror the translations.lisp file in the top level ofthe directory.  The system file should use the sysdcl.lisp file in the toplevel of the directory for the system source file.  After the files have beenset up, the standard Symbolics system functions can be used.Start up a base lisp worldExecute ":Compile System ideal-edit" or ":Load System ideal-edit"  (This will load the IDEAL system also.  However, the IDEAL system must have   been compiled at least once prior to this so that it can be loaded.)

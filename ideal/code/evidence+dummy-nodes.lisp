;-------------------------- Dummy Nodes --------------------------

; DUMMY NODES: Evidence is set up as a dummy node that is a child of the
; affected node. Including dummy nodes in the implementation has the
; following effects:

; 1) When initializing the diagram the dummy nodes have to be deleted.
; Dummy nodes may exist in a diagram that is being initialized if it is
; a digram that is being reused.

; 2) In checking singly-connected-p the check has to be made on a an
; "extended" diagram consisting both of the original nodes and the dummy
; nodes. This check is made just as u start poly-tree-infer. Dummy nodes
; may exist in a diagram at this stage if it is being used incrementally
; (i.e poly-tree-infer is run repeatedly on the diagram. with new
; evidence each time).

;3) When creating a dummy node for a piece of evidence relating to a
;node any dummy nodes  that are already attached to the nodes (i.e old
;evidence pertaining to the node) has  to be deleted.
; The way that dummy evidence nodes have been implemented now,
;create-evidence-list creates evidence-items for those nodes whose
;evidence has changed since the last pass of poly-tree-infer over the
;diagram. So effectively, poly-tree-infer is smart and propogates only
;evidence that has changed and does not repropogate evidence that is
;same but has been redeclared. To force evidence that is same to
;repropogate you have to ensure that node-old-state of the evidence node
;is different from node-state of the evidence node. One way to do this
;is to simply set node-old-state to nil after the evidence has been
;propogated.

;4)  When used by the clique algorithm the dummy node is created just to be
; a record of the evidence pertaining to the node that has been
; propogated so far. Why such a roundabout thing ? Well, then the
; functions create-evidence, create-evidence-list, check-evidence etc
; created for poly-trees can be used exactly as is for handling the
; evidence for the clique algorithms too. Also, the evidence details for
; both poly-tree and clique-algorithms remains exactly the same and this
; is good.
